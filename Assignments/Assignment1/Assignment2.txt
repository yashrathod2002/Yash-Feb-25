5. Consider a program that uses the fork() system call to create a child process. Initially, the parent 
process has a variable x with a value of 5. After forking, both the parent and child processes 
increment the value of x by 1. 
      What will be the final values of x in the parent and child processes after the fork() call?
Ans: After the fork() call, both the parent and the child process will have their own independent copies of x, 
  and both will have a final value of x = 6.
